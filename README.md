# Behavioural Economics Reading Group

Welcome to the Behavioral Economics Reading Group course at the Department of Economics at the European University at Saint Petersburg! This site will provide you with information and materials necessary for the course, namely:

- a [course syllabus](about.md);
- a bi-weekly [course calendar](calendar.md) with readings;
- a schematic [schedule](schedule.md); and 
- a [staff](staff.md) page.



### Local development environment

Just the Class requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. To setup a local development environment, clone your template repository and follow the GitHub Docs on [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
