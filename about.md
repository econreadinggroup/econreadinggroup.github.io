## About

This course is offered by the Department of Economics at the European University at Saint Petersburg. The course is designed to introduce graduate students to classical and recent literature on various topics predominantly in the domain of behavioral economics and political economy.

## Lecture

The course is designed to function as a discussion group; therefore, no explicit lectures are scheduled, except for the first one—an introduction to the field, which will be delivered during the initial meeting.

## Assignments

Each participant in the course is expected to familiarize themselves with all the papers scheduled for a particular meeting (detailed information on the meeting schedule and respective readings will be available here after the first course meeting). Being prepared to discuss the key aspects of each paper—its motivation, theoretical/empirical/experimental background, hypotheses, research methodology, key findings, and general discussion—is essential to fully participate in the group discussion.
