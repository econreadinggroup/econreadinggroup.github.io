## About

This is a _Behavioral Economics Reading Group_ course. This course is offered by the Department of Economics at the European University at Saint Petersburg. The course is designed to introduce graduate students to classical and recent literature on various topics predominantly in the domain of behavioral economics and political economy.

## Lecture

The course is designed to function as a discussion group; therefore, no explicit lectures are scheduled, except for the first one—an introduction to the field, which will be delivered during the initial meeting.

## Assignments

Each participant in the course is expected to familiarize themselves with all the papers scheduled for a particular meeting (detailed information on the meeting schedule and respective readings will be available here after the first course meeting). Being prepared to discuss the key aspects of each paper—its motivation, theoretical/empirical/experimental background, hypotheses, research methodology, key findings, and general discussion—is essential to fully participate in the group discussion.

## Resources

All resources will be made available to course participants.


## Fraud, Plagiarism, & Academic Integrity

Any instance of academic dishonesty will be considered a grave offense. Each participant in the course is expected to be familiar with and adhere to the norms and values that uphold academic integrity. The most severe transgressions that undermine this integrity include fraud and plagiarism. Plagiarism, a type of fraud, is defined as the unauthorized use of another author’s work without appropriate citation. Please be aware that the deliberate usage of AI-generated content (e.g., ChatGPT) in the final paper will be deemed as fraud. In the event that the course instructor uncovers a case of fraud or plagiarism, the University’s Ethical Committee may impose substantial sanctions on the offender. The most stringent sanction that the Committee may impose is the submission of a request for the student’s expulsion to the University Board.
